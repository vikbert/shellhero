## Scripts Qualifications

Here are some rules to follow when adding a resource to make sure it qualifies:

- Make sure the scripts is not too specific of a topic.
- Take the time to make sure the script has not been already added as it saves the maintainers time when reviewing your pull request.
- Make sure the resource is objective and not opinionate
- No links to personal projects that have helped you learn something, unless the link is a tutorial or guide on how you did that project.
- No links to twitter accounts, telegram channels, Youtube channels (Youtube videos and playlists are allowed), and so on.
- No content with licensing issues.

## Adding A New Script
For example, I am going to add a new script named `phps` and use it as local command on macos.

1. create the script with name `/src/phps.sh`
2. add make command in `Makefile` for installing `phps.sh` as local command on macos
3. add the description of the new script to `README.md` to clarify how to use your script
